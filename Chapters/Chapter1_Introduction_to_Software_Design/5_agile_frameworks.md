Common agile methodologies include:

__Scrum__: Scrum is one of the most widely used agile frameworks, featuring roles such as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. It emphasizes short, time-boxed iterations called sprints, daily stand-up meetings, and a prioritized backlog of work items.
It uses a series of short sprints (typically 1-4 weeks) to deliver work in small, iterative increments.

__Kanban__: Kanban is a visual framework for managing work, often used in conjunction with agile methodologies like Scrum. It involves visualizing work items on a Kanban board, limiting work in progress (WIP), and optimizing flow to improve efficiency.

__Extreme Programming (XP)__: XP is an agile methodology that focuses on technical practices such as test-driven development (TDD), pair programming, continuous integration(CI), and frequent releases. XP emphasizes engineering practices to ensure high-quality software.

| Framework       | Scrum is a framework for managing and organizing work, focusing on delivering value in short iterations called sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks. | Kanban is a lean methodology focused on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and optimizing flow to improve efficiency and throughput. |
| Roles           | Scrum defines specific roles, including Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. | Kanban typically does not prescribe specific roles like Scrum does. Instead, it encourages collaboration and self-organization within the team. |
| Artifacts       | Scrum has several artifacts, including the product backlog (a prioritized list of work items), sprint backlog (the subset of items from the product backlog selected for the current sprint), and increment (the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint). | Kanban uses a visual board (Kanban board) to visualize the flow of work through different stages (e.g., to-do, in progress, done). |
| Events          | Scrum defines several events or ceremonies, including sprint planning, daily stand-up meetings, sprint review, and sprint retrospective. | Kanban does not have predefined events like Scrum does. However, teams may choose to hold regular meetings to review the board and discuss work in progress. |
| Iterations      | Scrum emphasizes fixed-length iterations (sprints), with a focus on delivering a potentially shippable product increment at the end of each sprint. | Kanban does not have fixed iterations like Scrum. Work is pulled into the system as capacity allows, and there is a continuous flow of work through the workflow stages. |
| WIP Limits      | Scrum does not impose explicit limits on work in progress (WIP). | Kanban imposes limits on the number of work items that can be in progress at any given time (WIP limits), which helps prevent overloading the team and encourages focus on completing work before starting new items. |
| Adaptability    | Scrum is less adaptable compared to Kanban, as it follows a fixed framework with predefined roles and events. | Kanban is highly adaptable and flexible, allowing teams to adjust their process and priorities quickly in response to changes in demand or requirements. |
