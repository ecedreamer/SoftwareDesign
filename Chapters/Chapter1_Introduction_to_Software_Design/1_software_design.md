## Software ##
- Software is essentially a set of instructions, or programs, that tell a computer what to do. It's like the brain of the computer, working with the physical components (hardware) to make everything function.
- There are two main ways to categorize software:
### Major Category ###
- System Software
- Application Software

### Other Categories ###
- Programming Software
- Enterprise Software
- Embedded Software
- Web-based Software
- Driver Software
- Middleware
- Malware
- Firmware etc


## Software Design ##
- Software design is the process of conceptualizing and planning the software solution to meet specified requirements. 
- It encompasses several activities and decisions aimed at creating a system that is reliable, maintainable, scalable, and efficient. 
- Software design involves both high-level architectural decisions and low-level detailed design choices.


## Software Engineering ##
- Software engineering is a discipline that involves applying engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. 
- It encompasses various methodologies, tools, and techniques aimed at creating high-quality, reliable, and efficient software products.


## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)  ##

### Planning  ###
Identify Requirements, Feasibility Study, Scope Definition, Resource Allocation, Timeline and Milestones, Risk Assessment, Technology Selection, Budgeting etc

### Requirements Analysis: ###
Understanding and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements of the software system. This involves gathering information from stakeholders to determine what the software should do and how it should behave.

### Architectural Design: ### 
Defining the overall structure of the software system. This includes identifying components, their relationships, and how they interact with each other. Common architectural styles include layered architecture, client-server architecture, and microservices architecture.

### Detailed Design: ### 
Breaking down the system into smaller modules or components and specifying their interfaces, behavior, and interactions. This involves decisions about data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.

### User Interface (UI) Design: ### 
Designing the user interface components and interactions to ensure usability and user satisfaction. This includes wireframing, prototyping, and designing the visual layout of screens or pages.

### Database Design: ### 
Designing the structure of the database or data storage mechanism to efficiently store, retrieve, and manage data. This involves defining tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints.

### System Integration: ### 
Planning and designing how different modules or components will integrate and interact with each other. This may involve defining communication protocols, APIs, and data formats.

### Security Design: ### 
Incorporating security measures to protect the software system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. This includes authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure coding practices.

### Performance Optimization: ### 
Identifying potential performance bottlenecks and designing the software system to be scalable, responsive, and efficient. This may involve techniques such as caching, load balancing, and optimizing algorithms.

### Testing Strategy: ### 
Planning the testing approach and designing test cases to validate the correctness, reliability, and quality of the software system. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

### Documentation: ### 
Creating documentation to describe the software design, including architecture diagrams, interface specifications, data models, and user manuals.

Software design is an iterative process that involves collaboration among stakeholders, including developers, designers, testers, and end-users, to refine and improve the design over time. Good software design is crucial for building high-quality software that meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.
