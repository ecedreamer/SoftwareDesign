# User Stories,  Story Points & Acceptance Criteria in Scrum

**User Stories:**

- Represent a feature or functionality of the product from the user's perspective.
- Written in a simple, concise format, typically following the structure: "As a [user role], I want [desired functionality] so that [benefit]."
- Focus on the user's needs and the value delivered by the feature.

**Examples:**
- "As a customer, I want to be able to search for products by category so that I can easily find what I'm looking for."
- "As a content editor, I want to be able to schedule blog posts for future publication so that I can manage my content calendar efficiently."

**Story Points:**

- Relative estimates of the effort, complexity, and uncertainty involved in completing a user story.
- Assigned by the Scrum team through collaborative discussion and planning.
- Don't directly translate to time (hours or days), but rather the overall effort required compared to other stories in the product backlog.
- Use a common scale, such as the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) to indicate the relative effort.

**How User Stories and Story Points Work Together:**

- User stories define what needs to be built, while story points provide an estimate of the effort required to build it.
- During sprint planning, the Scrum team considers user stories from the product backlog and assigns story points to each one.
- This collaborative estimation helps the team understand the relative complexity of each story and how much work can be realistically committed to in a particular sprint.
- By focusing on effort rather than time, story points account for factors like uncertainty, team knowledge, and external dependencies, making planning more adaptable.

**Benefits of User Stories and Story Points:**

- **Improved Communication:** User stories promote a shared understanding between stakeholders and the development team.
- **Focus on Value:** User stories keep the focus on delivering value to the end user.
- **Enhanced Estimation:** Story points provide a more flexible and realistic way to estimate effort compared to traditional time-based estimates.
- **Team Collaboration:** The process of assigning story points fosters discussion and collaboration within the Scrum team.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria
Writing user stories and acceptance criteria is an essential part of agile software development. User stories describe the functionality from the perspective of the end user, while acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.

Here are examples of user stories and acceptance criteria for a hypothetical project, such as a task management application:

### User Story 1: 
As a user, I want to create a new task so that I can keep track of things I need to do.

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The user can click a "New Task" button.
- The user must be able to save the task by clicking a "Save" button.
- The task appears in the task list after it is saved.
- The task details are stored in the database.


### User Story 2: 
As a user, I want to mark a task as complete so that I can see which tasks I have finished.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- Each task in the task list has a checkbox to mark it as complete.
- When the checkbox is clicked, the task is visually marked as completed (e.g., with a strikethrough or different color).
- The completed status is saved in the database.
- There is an option to undo the completion status.


### User Story 3: 
As a user, I want to edit a task so that I can update the task details if they change.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- Each task has an "Edit" button.
- Clicking the "Edit" button opens the task details in an editable form.
- The user can change the task title, description, and due date.
- The user can save the changes by clicking a "Save" button.
- The task list updates to show the edited details.
The changes are saved in the database.

### User Story 4: 
As a user, I want to delete a task so that I can remove tasks I no longer need.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- Each task has a "Delete" button.
- Clicking the "Delete" button shows a confirmation prompt (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this task?").
- The user can confirm or cancel the deletion.
- If confirmed, the task is removed from the task list.
- The task is deleted from the database.


### User Story 5: 
As a user, I want to view all tasks in a calendar view so that I can see my tasks organized by date.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- There is a "Calendar View" option in the navigation menu.
- Clicking the "Calendar View" option shows a calendar with tasks displayed on their due dates.
- The user can switch between month, week, and day views.
- Tasks are correctly positioned based on their due dates.
- The user can click on a task in the calendar to view its details.

### User Story 6: 
As a user, I want to receive notifications for upcoming tasks so that I am reminded of tasks I need to complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- The user can set notification preferences (e.g., how many minutes/hours/days before the task is due).
- Notifications are sent based on the user's preferences.
- Notifications include the task title and due date.
- The user can disable or adjust notification settings.
- Notifications are consistent across different devices if the user is logged in.


### Tips for Writing Good User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

#### User Stories:

- Keep them simple and concise.
- Focus on the "who", "what", and "why".
- Use the format: As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit].

#### Acceptance Criteria:

- Be clear and specific.
- Use bullet points for readability.
- Include functional and non-functional requirements if necessary.
- Ensure they are testable and measurable.
