## Class Diagram
A class diagram is a type of static structure diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that describes the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among the objects. It is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented design and analysis and is used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a system.

### Components of a Class Diagram
1. Classes:  Represent the blueprint of objects that are part of the system.

   - Attributes: Characteristics or properties of a class (e.g., name, age, ID).
   - Methods/Operations: Functions or behaviors that a class can perform (e.g., calculateSalary(), getName()).

2. Relationships:Define how classes interact with each other. There are several types of relationships:
   - Association: A general connection between classes, often with multiplicity indicators (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
   - Inheritance/Generalization: Denotes an "is-a" relationship where one class inherits from another.
   - Aggregation: A special form of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship, but the part can exist independently of the whole.
   - Composition: A stronger form of aggregation where the part cannot exist independently of the whole.
   - Dependency: A relationship where one class depends on another for some behavior or functionality.
3. Visibility: Determines the accessibility of class members.
    - "+" (Public): Accessible from any other class.
    - "-" (Private): Accessible only within the class itself.
    - "#" (Protected): Accessible within the class and its subclasses.
