## Agile Methodology ##

Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional waterfall methodologies, which often led to lengthy development cycles and difficulties in accommodating changing requirements.

### Foundational values of Agile ###

1. #### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
This value emphasizes the importance of people and their interactions in software development. Agile teams prioritize effective communication, collaboration, and teamwork over relying solely on processes or tools. It acknowledges that the success of a project depends largely on the individuals involved and their ability to work together effectively.

2. #### Working software over comprehensive documentation
Agile values tangible results over extensive documentation. While documentation is important, the primary measure of progress is the delivery of working software to customers. Agile teams aim to deliver value early and frequently, focusing on creating functional software that meets the needs of users rather than spending excessive time on documentation that may not directly contribute to the end product.

3. #### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Agile encourages close collaboration between development teams and customers throughout the project lifecycle. Rather than relying on rigid contracts and negotiations, agile teams work closely with customers to understand their needs, gather feedback, and adapt to changing requirements. By involving customers directly in the development process, agile teams can ensure that the final product meets their expectations and delivers value.

4. #### Responding to change over following a plan
Agile recognizes that change is inevitable in software development. Instead of rigidly adhering to a predefined plan, agile teams embrace change and adapt their approach based on feedback, new insights, and evolving requirements. Agile methodologies prioritize flexibility, iterative development, and continuous improvement, enabling teams to respond quickly and effectively to changes in the project environment.

### Agile Manifesto Principles

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software:**
    - Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development:**
    - Embrace changes in requirements, even late in the development process. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver working software frequently, with a preference to the shorter timescale:**
    - Aim to deliver a working product incrementally, with smaller, more frequent releases.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project:**
    - Encourage close collaboration between business stakeholders and development teams throughout the project.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done:**
    - Empower and trust individuals within the team, providing them with the resources and support needed to achieve project goals.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation:**
    - Value direct and frequent communication among team members, which is often more effective than written documentation.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress:**
    - Focus on delivering tangible value to the customer through working software, rather than solely on completing tasks or following a plan.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely:**
    - Strive for a sustainable pace of work that allows teams to maintain high productivity over the long term without burning out.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility:**
    - Emphasize the importance of technical excellence and quality in all aspects of software development to support agility and adaptability.

10. **Simplicityâ€”the art of maximizing the amount of work not done:**
    - Prioritize simplicity in both the software being developed and the processes used to develop it, aiming to eliminate unnecessary work and complexity. For every feature, ask "Does this deliver value to the user?" If not, consider postponing or eliminating it.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams:**
    - Encourage self-organizing teams to collaboratively determine the best solutions and approaches for the project, leveraging their collective expertise and insights.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly:**
    - Foster a culture of continuous improvement and reflection, where teams regularly assess their processes, practices, and interactions and make adjustments to enhance effectiveness and efficiency.
