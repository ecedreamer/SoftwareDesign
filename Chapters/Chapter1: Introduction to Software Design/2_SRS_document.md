# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Document

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose, functionality, and behavior of a software system. 
- It serves as a blueprint for the development team by outlining what needs to be built. 
- The SRS document is typically created during the early stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC) as part of the requirements analysis phase.

There are two main types of software requirements:

## 1. Functional requirements:
Functional requirements define the specific actions a system or software program should perform. They outline the features, functionalities, and behaviors that deliver the intended value to users. Here's a breakdown of functional requirements:

### Core Characteristics:

**Focus on "What" the System Does:** Functional requirements detail the system's functionalities and features, specifying what the system should be able to do.

**User-Centric Perspective:** They are typically written from the user's perspective, outlining the actions users can perform and the system's responses.

**Detailed Descriptions:** Functional requirements should be detailed enough to provide a clear understanding of the desired behavior but not so restrictive that they hinder potential implementation approaches.

### Examples of Functional Requirements:

#### i. In an e-commerce application:
- Users should be able to browse product categories and view product details.
- Users should be able to search for products by name or keyword.
- Users should be able to add items to a shopping cart and modify quantities.
- The system should calculate the total order amount with applicable taxes and discounts.
- The system should allow users to securely checkout using different payment methods.
#### ii. In a content management system (CMS):
- Users should be able to create, edit, and publish web pages.
- The system should allow users to upload and manage images and other media files.
- The system should provide options for controlling user access and permissions.
- The CMS should enable scheduling content to be published at a specific time.
### Importance of Functional Requirements:

#### Clear Communication: 
Well-defined functional requirements ensure clear communication between stakeholders (users, developers, etc.) about what the system should achieve.
#### Project Roadmap: 
They serve as a roadmap for the development process, guiding developers in building the functionalities that deliver user value.
#### Testing and Verification: 
Functional requirements are the basis for testing and verification to ensure the system performs as intended.

By clearly outlining functional requirements, you lay the foundation for a successful software development project that meets the needs of its users.

## 2. Non-functional requirements: 
Non-functional requirements (NFRs) specify how well a system should perform rather than what it should do. They define the qualities of the system that address usability, reliability, performance, and other important aspects. Here are some common examples of non-functional requirements:

### Performance: 
This refers to how fast the system responds to user input and how quickly it completes tasks. 
Examples of performance NFRs include:

- The system response time should be less than 2 seconds.
The system should be able to handle 1000 concurrent users.
### Scalability:
This refers to the ability of the system to accommodate growth in usage or data. 
Examples of scalability NFRs include:

- The system should be scalable to support a doubling of the user base within a year.
- The system should be able to handle a 20% increase in data volume per month.
### Security: 
This refers to protecting the system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. Examples of security NFRs include:

- The system must comply with industry-standard security protocols.
- All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
### Availability: 
This refers to the amount of time the system is operational and accessible to users. Examples of availability NFRs include:

- The system must be available 99.9% of the time.
- Downtime for scheduled maintenance should not exceed 4 hours per month.
### Usability: 
This refers to how easy the system is to learn and use for its intended audience. Examples of usability NFRs include:

- The system should be intuitive and user-friendly for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- The system should provide clear and concise error messages.
### Reliability: 
This refers to the consistency and dependability of the system over time. Examples of reliability NFRs include:

- The system should function correctly without errors at least 95% of the time.
- The system should recover from failures quickly and gracefully.
### Maintainability: 
This refers to how easy it is to modify and repair the system. Examples of maintainability NFRs include:

- The system code should be well-documented and easy to understand.
- The system should be modular so that changes can be made to one part without affecting other parts.
### Compliance: 
This refers to the system's adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. Examples of compliance NFRs include:

- The system must comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.
- The system must meet accessibility standards for users with disabilities.

etc. 

## Example
## Software For Interacting ML Model

### 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for the development of a software application that hosts a machine learning model. The software will provide an interface for users to interact with the model, input data, and receive predictions or insights.

### 2. Scope
The software will facilitate the deployment and management of a machine learning model within a production environment. It will provide functionality for:

- Uploading and preprocessing data for model training and testing.
- Training and retraining machine learning models.
- Deploying trained models to production for real-time predictions.
- Monitoring model performance and usage statistics.

### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 Data Management
- The software shall allow users to upload datasets in common formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Users shall be able to preprocess and clean data using built-in tools or custom scripts.
- The software shall support versioning of datasets to track changes over time.

#### 3.2 Model Training
- Users shall be able to select algorithms and configure hyperparameters for model training.
- The software shall provide tools for feature selection, extraction, and engineering.
- Model training shall be performed on scalable infrastructure to handle large datasets.

#### 3.3 Model Deployment
- Trained models shall be deployable as RESTful APIs for real-time predictions.
- The software shall support containerization of models for easy deployment to cloud platforms.
- Users shall have the ability to set resource limits and auto-scaling rules for deployed models.

#### 3.4 Monitoring and Analytics
- The software shall provide dashboards for monitoring model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, latency).
- Usage statistics such as prediction volume and error rates shall be logged and visualized.
- Alerts shall be configurable for abnormal model behavior or performance degradation.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The software shall be capable of handling large volumes of data and requests with low latency.
