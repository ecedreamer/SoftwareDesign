### Steps

#### Input
n = 5
answer = 120


#### Preparation
factorial = 1
i = 1

#### iteration 1

factorial = 1
i = 2

#### iteration 2
factorial = 2
i = 3

#### iteration 3
factorial = 6
i = 4

#### iteration 4
factorial = 24
i = 5

#### iteration 5
factorial = 120
i = 6

#### Exit from the loop due to the False condition
Since i > n; exit from the loop

#### Print the factorial
