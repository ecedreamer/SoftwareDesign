## Unified Modeling Language (UML) ##
UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It's a standardized modeling language used in software engineering to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software system. UML provides a standardized way to represent design blueprints, system architecture, and interactions among various components of a software system.

1. Class Diagrams: These illustrate the structure of the system by showing the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships among them.

2. Use Case Diagrams: They depict the interactions between a system and its users, focusing on the various ways users interact with the system.

3. Sequence Diagrams: These show the sequence of interactions between different objects or components in a system, typically focusing on the flow of messages between them over time.

4. Activity Diagrams: They model the flow of activities within a system, showing the sequence of actions or steps.

5. State Diagrams: These represent the various states that an object or system can be in and the transitions between these states.

6. Component Diagrams: They show the organization and dependencies of components within a system.

7. Deployment Diagrams: These depict the physical deployment of software components to hardware nodes.
