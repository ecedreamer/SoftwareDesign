## ER Diagram
An Entity Relationship Diagram is a diagram that represents relationships among entities in a database.

## Entity

## Relationship

### Cardinality
Defines the numerical attributes of the relationship between two entities or entity sets. The three main cardinal relationships are one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-many. 
- A one-to-one example would be one student associated with one mailing address. 
- A one-to-many example (or many-to-one, depending on the relationship direction): One student registers for multiple courses, but all those courses have a single line back to that one student. 
- Many-to-many example: Students as a group are associated with multiple faculty members, and faculty members in turn are associated with multiple students.
