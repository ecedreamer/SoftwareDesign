## Relational Database Management System
1. **Database**: A collection of related data stored in a structured format, typically organized into tables, indexes, views, and other objects.

2. **Table**: A structured set of data elements (rows and columns) organized in a grid format. Each column represents a specific attribute, while each row represents a unique record or entry.

3. **Column**: A vertical arrangement of data in a table, representing a specific attribute or field. Columns have a data type that defines the kind of data they can store (e.g., integer, string, date).

4. **Row**: A horizontal arrangement of data in a table, representing a single record or entry containing values corresponding to each column.

5. **Primary Key**: A column or a set of columns whose values uniquely identify each row in a table. It ensures data integrity and facilitates efficient data retrieval.

6. **Foreign Key**: A column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.

7. **Index**: A data structure used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table. It contains keys built from one or more columns, allowing for faster search and retrieval of data.

8. **Query**: A SQL statement used to retrieve, manipulate, or manage data in a database. Common types of queries include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN.

9. **View**: A virtual table generated from the result set of a SELECT query. Views allow users to query and manipulate data stored in multiple tables as if they were a single table.

10. **Constraint**: A rule or condition applied to data in a database to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules. Examples include primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, unique constraints, and check constraints.

11. **Normalization**: A process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency, thereby improving data integrity and minimizing data anomalies.

12. **Transaction**: A unit of work performed on a database, typically consisting of one or more SQL statements. Transactions ensure data consistency and integrity by either committing changes or rolling them back in case of errors.

13. **Stored Procedure**: A precompiled set of SQL statements stored in the database and executed as a single unit. Stored procedures can accept parameters, perform complex operations, and return results to the calling program.

14. **Trigger**: A database object that automatically executes a set of SQL statements in response to certain events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table.
