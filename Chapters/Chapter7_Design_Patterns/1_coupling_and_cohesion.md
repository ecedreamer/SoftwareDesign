## Coupling and Cohesion
Coupling and cohesion are essential concepts in software engineering that govern the relationships between different parts of your code. They significantly impact the maintainability, readability, and testability of your program.


### 1. Coupling
Coupling focuses on the interdependence between modules (functions, classes, etc.) in your program. Here's a breakdown of coupling levels:

- **High Coupling:** Modules are tightly knit and heavily rely on each other. Modifications in one module can easily cascade and affect others, making it challenging to modify or test individual parts.
- **Low Coupling:** Modules are independent with minimal interaction. Changes in one module have minimal impact on others, promoting modularity and easier maintenance.

### 2. Cohesion
Cohesion dives into the internal structure of a single module. It describes how effectively the elements within a module work together towards a specific goal. Here's how cohesion can vary:

- **High Cohesion:** The elements within a module are tightly focused and perform a single, well-defined task. This makes the code easier to understand and reuse.
- **Low Cohesion:** The elements within a module are loosely related and handle multiple unrelated tasks. This makes the code harder to reason about and maintain.


### Benefits of Low Coupling and High Cohesion:

- **Maintainability:** Low coupling and high cohesion lead to code that's easier to maintain. Changes are simpler to localize and less likely to cause unintended side effects.
- **Readability:** Well-coupled and cohesive code is easier to understand for both you and other developers. Each module's purpose and interaction with others are clear.
- **Testability:** Low coupling allows you to test modules in isolation, simplifying the testing process and improving test coverage.

### Striking a Balance:

While aiming for low coupling and high cohesion is ideal, it's not always achievable in every scenario. Sometimes, a bit of coupling is necessary for functionality. The key is to find a balance that promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability without sacrificing functionality.
