## Unit Testing

- Unit testing is a software testing technique used to validate the individual units or components of a software application in isolation. 

- A unit is the smallest testable part of a software system, typically a function, method, or class. The primary goal of unit testing is to verify that each unit of the software performs as expected, according to its specifications.


- Unit testing is a fundamental practice in modern software development methodologies such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). 

- By writing unit tests alongside production code, developers can improve code quality, detect bugs early, and build more robust and maintainable software systems.

## Key Aspects of Unit Testing

### Isolation
Unit tests are designed to test a single unit of code in isolation, meaning that the unit being tested should not rely on external dependencies such as databases, file systems, or network connections. Instead, dependencies are often replaced with mock objects or stubs to simulate their behavior.

### Automated
Unit tests are typically automated, meaning that they can be executed automatically without manual intervention. Automated tests allow developers to quickly run tests and verify the behavior of individual units as they make changes to the codebase.

### Fast Execution
Unit tests are designed to execute quickly, allowing developers to run them frequently during the development process without significant overhead. Fast execution speeds up the feedback loop and helps identify issues early in the development cycle.

### Assertions
Unit tests include assertions to validate the expected behavior of the unit being tested. Assertions compare the actual output of the unit with the expected output and report any discrepancies as test failures.

### Repeatable
Unit tests should produce consistent results regardless of when or where they are executed. Repeatable tests ensure that developers can rely on test outcomes to identify and diagnose issues reliably.

### Regression Testing
Unit tests serve as a form of regression testing, helping to ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs or unintended side effects. By running unit tests regularly, developers can catch regressions early and maintain the stability of the software.

### Test Coverage
Unit testing is often accompanied by the concept of test coverage, which measures the percentage of code that is exercised by unit tests. High test coverage indicates that a significant portion of the codebase is tested, reducing the likelihood of undiscovered defects.
