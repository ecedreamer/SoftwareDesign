### Unit testing on a project structure

### Practice 1: Writing Unit Tests after Writing Source Code
1. Make a project Folder
2. Create a source file and test file
3. Write source code first
4. Write unit tests for the code


### Practice 2: Following Test Driven Development(TDD)
1. Make a project Folder
2. Create a source file and test file
3. Write source code structure(eg. function signatures)
4. Write unit tests for the code
5. Complete source code based on unit test case results


### Practice 3: Better folder structure for source code and test code in a project
