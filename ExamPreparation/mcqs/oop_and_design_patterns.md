    - a. Proxy pattern
    - b. Adapter pattern
    - c. Decorator pattern

    - a.	Observational patterns
    - b.	Operational patterns
    - c.	Structural patterns 
    - d.	Functional patterns

3.	The Factory Method
    - a.	Allows subclasses to instantiate with various subclasses implementing the interface.
    - b.	Ensures a class only has one instance per class.
    - c.	Provides an object to placeholder for another object to control access to it.
    - d.	Acts as adapter to make incompatible interfaces compatible.

4.	Which of these states about Object Adapter pattern?
    - a.	The adapter can inherit adapter operations with appropriate semantics and pragmatics, override those with inappropriate semantics or pragmatics, and add operations needed for the new interface
    - b.	The adapter may hold a reference to the adapter and delegate must work to the adapter object
    - c.	All the mentioned
    - d.	None of the mentioned

5.	Which of the following best describes a generalization relationship in UML?
    - a.	A relationship that connects two classes and indicates that one class is a specialized version of the other. 
    - b.	A relationship that connects two classes and indicates that one class contains the other as a member.
    - c.	A relationship that connects two or more classes and indicates that the classes are related in some way. 
    - d.	A relationship that connects a class with an interface and indicates that the class implements the methods defined in the interface.

6.	If a class "Car" is associated with a class "Engine" and the "Car" class can exist independently, what type of UML relationship is this?
    - a.	 Inheritance
    - b.	 Composition
    - c.	 Aggregation
    - d.	 Association

7.	Which UML relationship allows a class to be associated with itself?
    - a.	 Inheritance
    - b.	 Composition
    - c.	 Aggregation
    - d.	 Recursive Association

8.	What is the main advantage of achieving low coupling between software components?
    - a.	It reduces the number of components in the system, making it easier to manage.
    - b.	It improves the performance of individual components.
    - c.	It minimizes the impact of changes in one component on other components.
    - d.	It ensures all components have high cohesion and can be combined into a single module.

9.	Cohesion is a measure of the degree to which the module's elements are functionally related. Rank the desired level of cohesion from least to most sought for in Object Oriented Programming?
    - a.	Function, sequence, temporal, logical
    - b.	Function, sequence, logical, temporal
    - c.	Logical, Temporal, Sequence, function
    - d.	Temporal, Logical Sequence, function

10.	Coupling is the measure of the degree of interdependence between the modules. Rank the desired level of coupling from most to least sought for in Object Oriented Programming?
    - a.	Data Coupling, Stamp Coupling, External Coupling and Content Coupling
    - b.	Data Coupling, External Coupling, Stamp Coupling and Content Coupling
    - c.	Control Coupling, Stamp Coupling, External Coupling and Content Coupling
    - d.	Content Coupling, Stamp Coupling, External Coupling and Data Coupling
