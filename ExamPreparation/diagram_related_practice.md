## Flow Chart Diagram
1. Draw a flow chart diagram for finding ODD number from n1 to n2 where n1 and n2 are positive integers and n2 > n1
2. Draw a flow chart diagram for finding whether a number is prime or not. 
3. Draw a flow chart diagram for print the prime numbers from n1 to n2 where n1 and n2 are positive integers and n2 > n1. 


## Use Case Diagram

1. Draw a use-case diagram for ATM machine for money withdrawl.

2. ABC Electronics is a chain of electronic retail stores that offers a wide range of consumer electronics and appliances. However, the current manual system for managing sales, inventory, and customer interactions is proving to be inefficient and error-prone. The management has decided to implement a new retail management system to streamline operations and improve customer satisfaction.Design a Use Case Diagram for ABC Electronics' retail management system, capturing the key functionalities and interactions between users and the system. Identify the main actors, use cases, and their relationships to represent the core functionalities of the system. The system should allow staff members to manage inventory, process sales, handle orders, track supplier information, and provide customer support. Customers should be able to browse products, make purchases, track their orders, and request assistance. Please ensure that your Use Case Diagram accurately represents the essential interactions between the actors (staff and customers) and the system to enhance ABC Electronics' retail operations and customer experience effectively. Additionally, include at least one "include" and "extend" relationship to demonstrate the modular nature of the system and its ability to handle various scenarios seamlessly.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

1. Draw an Entity Relationship diagram for Library management system where Books, Students, Librarians, Borrows and Returns are entities. 
   
2. XYZ Bookstore, a popular chain of bookshops, is facing operational challenges with its current information management system. The existing system only tracks basic inventory and customer data, which is insufficient to meet the demands of the growing business. The management has recognized the need for a more comprehensive solution to streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction. As a database designer, you have been tasked with designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the proposed new system. Design an ER diagram that caters to XYZ Bookstore's requirements. Identify the necessary entities, attributes, and relationships to ensure the new system can handle more than just inventory and customer data. The system should support functions such as sales tracking, supplier information, order management, and customer loyalty programs, enabling XYZ Bookstore to efficiently manage its retail operations. Provide an ER diagram depicting the entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities required for the new system, allowing XYZ Bookstore to effectively manage its diverse retail operations beyond inventory and customer data management.
