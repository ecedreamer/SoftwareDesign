    A relationship that connects two or more classes and indicates that the classes are related in some way.

What is the main advantage of achieving low coupling between software components? 

    It reduces the number of components in the system, making it easier to manage. 

    It improves the performance of individual components. 

    It minimizes the impact of changes in one component on other components. *

    It ensures all components have high cohesion and can be combined into a single module. 


Which of the following best describes coupling in software design?

    The degree to which components of a system are dependent on each other *
    The degree to which the tasks performed by a single module are related to each other
    The process of combining multiple modules into a single module
    The process of dividing a module into smaller, more manageable pieces

5. Case Study: 
   XYZ Bookstore, a popular chain of bookshops, is facing operational challenges with its current information management system. The existing system only tracks basic inventory and customer data, which is insufficient to meet the demands of the growing business. The management has recognized the need for a more comprehensive solution to streamline operations and enhance customer satisfaction. As a database designer, you have been tasked with designing an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for the proposed new system. 

    Design an ER diagram that caters to XYZ Bookstore's requirements. Identify the necessary entities, attributes, and relationships to ensure the new system can handle more than just inventory and customer data. The system should support functions such as sales tracking, supplier information, order management, and customer loyalty programs, enabling XYZ Bookstore to efficiently manage its retail operations. 

    Provide an ER diagram depicting the entities, attributes, relationships, and cardinalities required for the new system, allowing XYZ Bookstore to effectively manage its diverse retail operations beyond inventory and customer data management. 


6. Case Study									
   ABC Electronics is a chain of electronic retail stores that offers a wide range of consumer electronics and appliances. However, the current manual system for managing sales, inventory, and customer interactions is proving to be inefficient and error-prone. The management has decided to implement a new retail management system to streamline operations and improve customer satisfaction. 

    Design a Use Case Diagram for ABC Electronics' retail management system, capturing the key functionalities and interactions between users and the system. Identify the main actors, use cases, and their relationships to represent the core functionalities of the system. 

    The system should allow staff members to manage inventory, process sales, handle orders, track supplier information, and provide customer support. Customers should be able to browse products, make purchases, track their orders, and request assistance. 

    Please ensure that your Use Case Diagram accurately represents the essential interactions between the actors (staff and customers) and the system to enhance ABC Electronics' retail operations and customer experience effectively. Additionally, include at least one "include" and "extend" relationship to demonstrate the modular nature of the system and its ability to handle various scenarios seamlessly.
